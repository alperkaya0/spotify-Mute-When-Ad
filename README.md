You can decrease the sleeping seconds so that it will work better but work more, don't forget to increase 1000 (within the if statement's condition part) so that when counter = 3600/sleeping_factor you will refresh your token BUT since refreshing maybe take longer according to your internet connection i suggest you to making it lower than 3600/sleeping_factor for example if you time.sleep(1) every iteration so 3000 is a nice choice. And it refresh everytime you open the script.(Why 3600 because access token expires after 1 hour)
