Create a new app from spotify developers site, and fill the wanted constants within the code according to this video :</br>
You will need 4 things: Access Token, Refresh Token, Client ID, Client Secret. You can skip parts of the video. </br></br> And remember that your redirect url must be same at every part. </br></br>You can set it to anything you want unless you add it to whitelist(redirect urls section) from your app's dev page. </br> </br> The **code** will appear within the link when you get redirected. So don't search it within the page (page probably will refuse to connect). </br> Why so confusing and complicated ? Ask it to spotify...</br> </br>

You can decrease the sleeping seconds so that it will work better but work more,</br> don't forget to increase 1000 (line 115) so that when counter = 3600/sleeping_factor you will refresh your token BUT since refreshing maybe take longer according to your internet connection i suggest you to making it lower than 3600/sleeping_factor for example if you time.sleep(1) every iteration so 3000 is a nice choice. And it refresh everytime you open the script.(Why 3600 ? because access token expires after 1 hour)
