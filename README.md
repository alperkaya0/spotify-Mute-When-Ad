You will need 4 things: Access Token, Refresh Token, Client ID, Client Secret. You can skip parts of the video. </br></br> And remember that your redirect url must be same at every part. </br></br>You can set it to anything you want unless you add it to whitelist(redirect urls section) from your app's dev page (you may use **https://localhost:8888/callback/**). </br> </br> The **code** will appear within the link when you get redirected. So don't search it within the page (page probably will refuse to connect). </br></br> Why so confusing and complicated ? Ask it to spotify...</br> </br>
