Create a new app from spotify developers site, and fill the wanted constants within the code according to this video :</br>
You will need 4 things: Access Token, Refresh Token, Client ID, Client Secret. You can skip parts of the video.And remember that your redirect url must be same at every part.You can set it to anything you want unless you add it from your app's dev page. The **code** will appear within the link when you get redirected. So don't search it within the page (page probably will refuse to connect). Why so confusing and complicated ? Ask it to spotify...

You can decrease the sleeping seconds so that it will work better but work more,</br> don't forget to increase 1000 (line 115) so that when counter = 3600/sleeping_factor you will refresh your token BUT since refreshing maybe take longer according to your internet connection i suggest you to making it lower than 3600/sleeping_factor for example if you time.sleep(1) every iteration so 3000 is a nice choice. And it refresh everytime you open the script.(Why 3600 ? because access token expires after 1 hour)
